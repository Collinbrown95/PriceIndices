0 errors √ | 0 warnings √ | 0 notes √ 

## Downstream dependencies

I have also run R CMD check on downstream dependencies of httr 
(https://github.com/wch/checkresults/blob/master/httr/r-release). 
All packages that I could install passed.

## I run the following instruction successfully:

* devtools::check() -> 0 errors √ | 0 warnings √ | 0 notes √

* check_win_devel() -> -> 0 errors √ | 0 warnings √ | 0 notes √

* devtools::spell_check() -> Ok, done.

## Thank you very much!
